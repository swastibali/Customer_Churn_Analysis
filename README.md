# 📞 Customer Churn Analysis

📖 Overview

In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, retaining customers is essential for profitability and growth. This project analyzes customer data to uncover the factors driving churn and employs machine learning models to predict customer churn rates. Additionally, we created an interactive dashboard to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

🌟 Key Features

🔍 Data Exploration: Conducted in-depth analysis of customer demographics, services, and account details to understand churn patterns. 

🛠️ Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.  

🤖 Machine Learning Models:  
Logistic Regression  
Random Forest Classifier  
Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT) Classifier  
All models were implemented using a unified pipeline for streamlined training and evaluation.  
🎯 Parameter Tuning: Leveraged ParamGridBuilder and CrossValidator for hyperparameter optimization.  
📊 Performance Metrics: Evaluated models using F1-score, accuracy, and other classification metrics to ensure robust predictions.  
📈 Interactive Dashboard: Designed a dynamic dashboard to visualize customer churn trends, model predictions, and feature importance.  

💻 Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python  
Frameworks: PySpark, Databricks  
Libraries:  
PySpark MLlib for machine learning  
Pandas and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization  
StringIndexer and VectorAssembler for feature engineering  
Dashboard: Built an interactive dashboard to provide insights into customer churn and key predictive factors.  

🚀 Future Enhancements
